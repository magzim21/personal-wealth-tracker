### Deploying 🏋🏼

### Branching strategy 🚨

Default branch is `prod`.

#### Semantic Versioning

Code is versioned according to this convention [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).  
When a new commit is pushed to the default branch (`prod`), GHA runs an npm script which determines the next version and pushes a git tag. Optionally, it generates `CHANGELOG.md`.

- To force-trigger a new version without actually making any changes, run `git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: trigger release with empty commit" && git push`
